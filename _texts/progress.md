## The Śṛṅgāratilaka of Rudra Bhaṭṭa with the Rasataraṅgiṇī Commentary of Gopāla Bhaṭṭa

The *Śṛṅgāratilaka* of Rudra Bhaṭṭa (eleventh century?) is the first independent work in Indian literary history to deal with rasa, or emotion in art, and with the principal male and character types (*nāyaka-* and *nāyikā-bheda*) of the principal rasa, the erotic. While Rudra Bhaṭṭa's work exercised enormous influence on aesthetic thought and literary practice from the time it was written—for example, it became one of the key texts in the *rīti* tradition of Classical Hindi poetry—it seems to have attracted only one commentary, the *Rasataraṅgiṇī* of Gopāla Bhaṭṭa, which is published here for the first time.
