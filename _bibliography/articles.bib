	abstract = {Allison Busch places Padmakar Bhatt and his \textit{Himmatbahādurvirudāvalī} in the context of the literary and political imaginary of the eighteenth century. She shows how Padmakar inherits the genre of the \textit{virudāvalī} (itself a multi-faceted tradition) from Sanskrit, but also a rich lexicon from the vernacular, Arabic, and Persian. The form and language of his work thus reflect the changed political and cultural realities of his time. The seamless movement between modes of versified poetic description in the \textit{Himmatbahādurvirudāvalī} reflects Padmakar’s simultaneous function as both historian and poet.},

	abstract = {Brajbhasha literature is a domain of Mughal culture seldom investigated by scholars, to the detriment of our understanding of both. While the Mughal court is famed for its lavish support of Persian writers, a surprising number of Brajbhasha poets also attracted the notice of Mughal patrons. In this paper I look at the lives and texts of important Braj writers who worked in Mughal settings, with a view to uncovering the nature of the social, political and cultural interactions that this kind of patronage represents. Why these poets have been largely lost to social and literary history is another concern, along with the challenges of trying to recover their stories.},
