	abstract = {The wall-paintings in the Rajput fort at Bundi include the earliest and finest examples of court painting known in India. Only recently available for sustained study, these wall-decorations help to define the religious, literary and artistic interests of the court; the functions of the spaces they adorn; the political aspirations of the rulers; and the evolving relationships between one court, its Rajput neighbors, and its Mughal overlords. True understanding of the wall-paintings is impossible without knowledge of the walls that support them, the ceremonials they surrounded or described, and the events, conflicts and alliances which brought the court (and the painters) into contact with other geographic areas and cultural traditions of India. Scholars have recently located local historical chronicles and literary texts (in Hindi) that yield important new information about court life. Additional projects have produced plans and measured drawings of the buildings within the fort at Bundi, as well as photographic documentation of the wall-paintings in situ. Since this is all new, separately conceived information, full publication and coordination of these discoveries is essential, and it should transform understanding of Rajput painting and architecture in Rajasthan. -- Amazon.com.},

	abstract = {"This volume charts the contours of a reimagined and revitalized field of Indology in the light of the groundbreaking research of Sheldon Pollock. One of the many exciting aspects of Pollock s work is its unprecedented combination of classical textual study with cutting edge theoretical and social scientific inquiry -- a combination which this book sets out to emulate. Pollock has trained and inspired a new generation of scholars, many of whom have contributed to this volume. The essays are organized into five groups that reflect the major domains of Pollock's immense contributions to the field: the epic Ramayana, Sanskrit literature and literary theory, systematic thought in premodern South Asia, the birth of a new vernacular cultural order in the subcontinent during the second millennium CE, and India's early modernity. Most of the essays concentrate on materials in Sanskrit, but there are also considerable contributions to the history of Hindi, Tamil, and Persian literatures. The book presents for the first time an overview of the groundbreaking contributions of Sheldon Pollock to South Asia scholarship over the past three decades, while offering a set of critiques of key elements of his theories."--Dust jacket.},
