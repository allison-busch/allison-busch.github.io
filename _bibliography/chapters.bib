	abstract = {Of virtually no modern historian other than D.D. Kosambi (1907 1966) can it be said: He changed the way in which Indian history was conceptualized and written. In fact, the term Renaissance man springs to mind because Kosambi s intellectual contributions cross disciplinary boundaries, ranging from ancient history to mathematics to Sanskrit literature to numismatics to India s energy policy. This book contains relatively unknown writings by Kosambi, including several obscure but important essays and an unpublished children s story. Also made available here for the first time are some wonderful letters that Kosambi wrote to, among others, the scientist Homi Bhabha and the writer-historian Robert Graves. These reveal Kosambi s mastery of the epistolary art. Other sections contain tributes to Kosambi by his friends, and essays by major contemporary scholars on his contributions in diverse fields. The volume gives a new and well-rounded picture of Kosambi s writings, as well as mature assessments of his scholarship by some of the best minds of our time. The editor, Meera Kosambi, provides an Introduction which situates her father within his social, political, intellectual, and familial milieux.},

Le loka est un lieu de lumière, éclairé par les astres du jour et de la nuit. Il n'est cependant pas directement perçu comme un espace de lumière arraché à la forêt: le monde ne saurait subsister tout seul, sans le "non-monde" ('aloka') qui l'entoure. Réfléchir 'aux abords de la clairière' signifie donc saisir du même regard la forêt tout autour, penser l'articulation nécessaire entre monde et non-monde. Depuis une quarantaine d'années, les travaux de Charles Malamoud marquent le paysage des études indiennes en France comme à l'étranger et ne cessent d'ouvrir des pistes d'investigations, à la fois méthodologiques et conceptuelles, dans les sciences humaines et sociales.},

	isbn = {978-0-231-17391-9},
	abstract = {From the early years of the Common Era to 1700, Indian intellectuals explored with unparalleled subtlety the place of emotion in art. Their investigations led to the deconstruction of art's formal structures and broader inquiries into the pleasure of tragic tales. Rasa, or taste, was the word they chose to describe art's aesthetics, and their passionate effort to pin down these phenomena became its own remarkable act of creation. This book is the first in any language to follow the evolution of rasa from its origins in dramaturgical thought'a concept for the stage'to its flourishing in literary thought'a concept for the page. Reader on Rasa incorporates primary texts by every significant thinker of classical Indian aesthetics, many never translated before. The arrangement of the selections captures the intellectual dynamism that has powered this debate for centuries. Headnotes explain the meaning and significance of each text, a comprehensive introduction summarizes major threads in intellectual-historical terms, and critical endnotes and an extensive bibliography add further depth to the selections. The Sanskrit theory of emotion in art is one of the most sophisticated in the ancient world, a precursor of the work being done today by critics and philosophers of aesthetics. This volume's conceptual detail, historical precision, and clarity will appeal to any scholar interested in a full portrait of global intellectual development. Reader on Rasa is the inaugural book in the Historical Sourcebooks in Classical Indian Thought series, edited by Sheldon Pollock. These text-based books guide readers through the most important forms of classical Indian thought, from epistemology, rhetoric, and hermeneutics to astral science, yoga, and medicine. Each volume provides fresh translations of key works, headnotes to contextualize selections, a comprehensive analysis of major lines of development within the discipline, and exegetical and text-critical endnotes, as well as a bibliography. Designed for comparativists and interested general readers, Historical Sourcebooks is also a great resource for advanced scholars seeking authoritative commentary on challenging works.},
